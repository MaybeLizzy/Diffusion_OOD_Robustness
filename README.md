Code attachments to better understand the paper “[How Does Diffusion Influence Pretrained Language Models on Out-of-Distribution Data?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.13949.pdf)”

Models finetuned with different ID datasets using diffusion are presented in huggingface: [20ng](https://huggingface.co/Maybe1407/diffusion_robustness_20ng), [sst2](https://huggingface.co/Maybe1407/diffusion_robustness_sst2/blob/main/README.md), [trec](https://huggingface.co/Maybe1407/diffusion_robustness_trec), [imdb](https://huggingface.co/Maybe1407/diffusion_robustness_imdb).
Please download and move them into the corresponding directory under"./model".
The OOD detection results of four different ID datasets are shown in "./ood_datection".
