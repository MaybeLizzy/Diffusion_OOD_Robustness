Code attachments to better understand the paper “[How Does Diffusion Influence Pretrained Language Models on Out-of-Distribution Data?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.13949.pdf)”

Models finetuned with different ID datasets using diffusion are presented in "./model".
The OOD detection results of four different ID datasets are shown in "./ood_datection".
